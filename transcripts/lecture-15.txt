[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Okay, so today the topic of the class is computer ethics,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   as you probably have seen from the calendar.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Yes.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   So I would like you to use a file in your computer or piece of paper as you prefer,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   to collect the answer to a few questions that I will ask you during this class,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   which are useful for connecting theoretical concepts with something which is more related to your view of the world.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Because ethics has to do with this.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So let's start with a question. The question is what is ethics for you?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   This question I'm not asking you to submit your answer or anything, so it's up to you if you want to copy and paste the definition
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   of what you think is a reliable source or if you want to try to see what is your own attempt to define what is ethics.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Maybe you want to share or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   OK. So maybe we can hear some of your definition if you like, but before let me show you one which is maybe something we would not like to subscribe to.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But it's interesting to look at.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   This is a comic strip, Peers Before Swine, and the characters in this strip are animals, the goat and the mouse in this case.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   In general, the mouse in this comic is a character which is very cynical, somehow negative, bad guy, and the goat is the good guy.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The mouse says, I concluded that the key to living an ethical life is to always pose before I do anything, and that's myself the key moral question, which is what?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And the answer is, can I get away with it?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I don't think that's more accessible, but not if you get caught. So somehow, can I get away with it?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And if I do not get caught, that would be fun.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Which is fun, and it's fun because you see the distance, but also it's fun because I don't know about you, but many people, I can include myself in this, in a few, at least occasions in life,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   do something which is not really acceptable, but, you know, okay, is it right to cross a traffic light which is red?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   No. Okay? But what if there is nobody around? No people, no cars, no bicycle, no nothing. The traffic light is there. It's a different cross between two roads.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Maybe it's just a, you have the traffic light for pedestrians to cross the street, and there is no pedestrian surround.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You are there one minute, and you're still there.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Do you think it is ethical to pass? Well, maybe in general not, but in this particular situation, yes.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But if there is a chance that you are caught, would you pass?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   If you notice a camera on the traffic light, you say, okay, maybe I wait for another few minutes.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So that means basically the same. If you're not caught, if you are a good chance not to be caught, in that particular situation, you say, okay, there is no reason, no reason.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Check, double check, triple check, and then what do you do? So, let's see if you like some of your definitions.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Yes?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   You have to speak very loud because there is the meeting system.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   We will see something very similar. Your colleague is basically saying that ethics is guiding the actions according to moral principles, which are related, let me say, to what is beneficial or not, harmful or not, regarding others and the self.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And what is more important, the self or the others is a matter of exploration.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Someone else? Okay, let's see what some reliable source is saying.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   So the Merriam Webster, the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Wikipedia, which are, I did track who started the book from the book, but they're very similar.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So Merriam Webster says that ethics is an area of study that deals with ideas about what is good and bad behavior, a branch of philosophy dealing with what is morally right or wrong.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy is saying that ethics is the field of ethics, or moral philosophy involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And Wikipedia is basically saying the same.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So ethics has to do with our habits, behavior, and the criteria guiding our decision.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Very much similar to what your colleague was saying.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Do you see your definition and connection with this somehow similar or in a different direction?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   At any rate, I would like to point you that there is a recurring pattern in these definitions.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So it's dealing with what is right and wrong. So now the point is somehow to figure out what is the meaning of right and wrong in the context of our actions.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   There is an ethical issue if I need to decide what is right or wrong in the course of my action.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And okay, good, but what is the way for discriminating what is right from what is wrong?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   How can we operationalize somehow, at least define, what is right?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So there is a branch of philosophy which is somehow connected and, how do you say, this is an issue before saying ethics or moral philosophy.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Is sometimes used as a synonym or morality is more related with the definition of right and wrong, the theoretical distinction.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Why ethics is something which is more directed towards addressing questions which are so-called ethical issues.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   But still, we are again left with the definition of what is right and what is wrong. How can we define what is right?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   So it's a challenge for you. Can you try to write your own definition of right, maybe with one example, and possibly, which is easier actually, a counter example, an example of wrong?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Can you try to write the three of these or maybe one? The definition of right is not so easy.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   There is no right definition of right.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You can try to figure out a situation where it is clear to you what could be the right decision and the wrong decision.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Try to figure out what is guiding your definition of right and wrong decision.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Somebody want to try?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   (inaudible)
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Basically, you decide your definition is based on the universality.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   If the action could be universal, then everybody could do this without creating damage.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Someone agrees or disagree with this definition?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   (inaudible)
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Your colleague is saying that universality is a criteria.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I can do this if it is not a problem if everybody does this.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So, we live in a privileged part of the world.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Many of our habits and many of the things we commonly do in terms of food or resources consumption in general are very difficult to think of as universal.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   If everybody would have the same level of quality of life according to this, it would be difficult for the planet Earth.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   (inaudible)
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   It is a very lax definition. It is fairly intertwined with society.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I can raise my voice if you prefer.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Right is something that you do that contributes in a positive way to your society.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Basically, it is really lax because something good to society is debatable.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   So, I am moving the problem to what is good to society. What is good to society you have to ask in our country to politicians and activists.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I am trying to figure out if I could ask everybody in my society what would they say.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Basically, everyone of us has different moral values. This theory has been there since the 19th century.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   This is for me what is right.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I am trying to figure out several examples of things that are acceptable from society in one part of the world and not in another part of the world.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   For example, in the last 10,000 km from here, there are certainly examples of things that are not acceptable or acceptable in the US.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   They are not considered as good for society.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   That depends.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Let's postpone. We will not reach a consensus on deciding what is right and what is wrong. There is no way.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It is about the fact that is it possible to give prescription or not.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   As a matter of fact, if you want to look at ethics in different perspectives, from different angles, there is a branch of ethics which is meta-ethics, which is trying to figure out where our principles are coming from.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Are our principles, the ethical concepts, something which is socially constructed, socially mentioned, or are they just an expression of our intention, of our emotion, our view of the simple, personal view?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Is it something which is given from the outside, whatever the outside is?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   The origin meaning of ethical concepts is the topic of meta-ethics, which is also deciding how do we conceive ethics, if it is something which is universal or not universal.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   There is another way which is more practical. Try to define some moral standard which is regulating our knowledge.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Basically helping us in deciding if we should do this or not. Is it right or wrong?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   The golden rule is a very well-known example of normative principles. We should do to others what we want the others to do to us.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   It is very simple, somehow. It is often applicable, but not always.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It can be used for guiding our actions. I shouldn't steal my neighbor's car because I prefer they want to steal mine.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   There is a way for guiding our actions.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   This is somehow trying to define our duties. We figure out the consequences of our behavior. It is not always possible, but it is a relatively well-known and used, broadly used principle.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Basically all the normative ethics is to figure out how somebody should act in these situations.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Applied ethics is related to very narrow topics.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It is related to the universe of ethical issues.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   For instance, specific issues, like capital punishment, biotech, and so on.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Or biological issues. The kind of study that can be done or not with living entities.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Business ethics, regulating and helping business people to regulate their decision about the theoretical values.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Or computer ethics. There is an ethics which is related to computers, computer science, and then the computer kid, information technology.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   AI ethics is something which is very commonly talked about in the last couple of years.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Let's see some of these points in more detail.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   For instance, meta-ethics. As I said, one of the points which is studied by meta-ethics is the distinction between objectivism and re-ethics.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Where are our ethical values coming from? Where are the guidelines for deciding what is wrong and what is wrong?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Are they societal constructs? Or moral values of human invention?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   These are universal. These kinds of values are defined somewhere outside the human society.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   This could be a religious view, but it could also be not religious in a standard way we define it.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I think that the law of nature should guide my ethical decisions. The laws of nature are outside of the human society.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   In the Plato, the Greek philosopher was explaining that the key values of guiding human actions are
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   decided by abstract entities which exist in another dimension of reality.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   We cannot access these realities except from accessing these manifestations which are the values.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   So moral values are like spiritual objects which are not questionable because they are not our creation.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   If you take this article, it is the ethical values are defined in a way which is not subject to the inclination of decisions of the human society.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   So in one society is accepted as dead or empty, in another one is not.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   But it is not that we can say that ethical values are different in these two parts of the world.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   We can say, according to this, that one is right and the other one is wrong.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   While relativism is just supporting the opposite.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   So moral values are human eventually created by society.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Individuals could create their own moral standards if you want to have an individual level of relativism.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Nietzsche was an example of this.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Or if you take a broader view that is stating that morality is grounded in the approval of society which is something which you more or less express in your statements.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   This is really the approval of society is changing across time, across cultures, polygamy.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Is it acceptable or not?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Human sacrifice.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   You just travel in time enough and you live in societies where it was culturally not only acceptable but good, beneficial for the society to sacrifice humans.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Now it is somehow an alien concept to us because to sacrifice someone is good for the society.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Unless it is a particular case, you can sacrifice a person for the sake of other people.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   It is a different story.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It is about the society, the central values.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   So it is not an easy choice in general.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   But the question, are you more an objectivist or a relativist?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   If you look at the previous answer that you gave, what is right and what is right?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Do you think it reflects an objectivist or a relativist?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Have you stated something like what is good is good for the society?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Or what is the definition?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I think that I can speak for everyone but I think that the majority of people have relativistic views about ethics and morals.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   But I don't know.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Your career is saying that most people have a relativist view about ethics.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Because an objective view is more common in people that are like evangelists and people that have a real strong roots in religion.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But that's my opinion so I don't know if...
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   An objectivist, universalist view is very closely connected to a bigger, stronger religious belief in religion.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   In most cases, yes, but not all of us.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   There are people who are firmly convinced of universal values, ethical values, without having a strong attachment to a religion.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And vice versa.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   What do you think of your belief statement?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   What other beliefs would be rejected?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Political opinions, political ideology could drive a strong ethical view and ethical values?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   I don't know the English terminology but maybe "inattisti" basically...
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Inattista in Italian, I don't know if it is also in English "inattista" or something but I don't think so.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   If people are born with already some concept like hard-coded in themselves.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   So basically if you have some moral or ethics hard-coded in you at birth, maybe it's an objective one.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   It's an objective view. So not only people who follow a religion can be an objectivist but maybe also people that adhere to some philosophical view.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   That is not basically one of the humanist ones and the post-humanist ones like Kant, Nietzsche and such.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I think that Plato did say that the Hyperuranean was the other dimension that is not engraved in Greek mythology and religion but is something that is theorized outside of religion.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Nowadays, yeah, basically if you adhere to some philosophical view that is not a relativistic one I think.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   It's not that you consider that we are born with some genetic traits which are influencing our view of the world. That's enough already because it's more or less in the direction of what you are relating to.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So it's everything which is our view of the world completely shaped by the time we are born, the vocation we are born, the family, the society, the school and so on.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So from our interaction with the world or there is something which is in our genes and this something could be the origin for thinking that there is at least some values which are universal.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Or you could say that for the survival of the human race, it's right or wrong.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   We believe that this is the driving process that should aim our action.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   So you don't need strictly a religion. The religion is the most common situation for a human asset.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But it's not the only one.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And to be complete, to be fair, it is also true that it's very hard to find people who are completely universal, which are saying that there is no baby or which is relativist.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   It's not relative to society or vice versa.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Because we tend to adjust our view depending on the situation, the context and so on.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Sometimes we tend to be universal regarding some issues. In some other situations we tend to be the...
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Can you consider a situation in which it would be acceptable having non-consent sex with a child?
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Don't start questioning the age of the child or something.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Can you consider a situation which from a relativist point of view, but if in that situation, it's very difficult.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   There are certain values which we try to say, okay, in this case it's universally decidable that this is right or this is wrong.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And if we go to the next step, for instance, talking about the same, is it right or wrong to kill the person who had sex, unconsent sex with a child?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   I now began consent to take out whatever...
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   ...to our society in this dealing with these situations and what is normally thought as right or wrong and what is your adherence or not to the societal rules and so on and so forth.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   But it's very tricky to distinguish and to fear me, to fear me, follow a relativism or universal in all our decisions.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   That's why normative ethics can help and trying to apply ethical principles and reasoning into something which is more operational.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   So talking about what are virtues, what are some people which are generally good, like generosity, justice or duties.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Take people as equal, compensate the undue, all these kinds of so-called moral duties that could drive our action.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Or consider the unfavourable consequences of actions.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   And this could drive us to ethical egoism, an action is morally right if the consequences of the action are more favourable than unfavourable for me, for myself.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I care, first of all I care for me and then I care for the others. Or altruism, I sacrifice myself rather than thinking to myself.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   So I, in trying to figure out the consequences of an action, I try to make sure that the consequences for the others are more positive than negative and then I consider the consequences on myself.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Or you can just try to count and try to balance, try to make sure that the majority, and I count as everyone else, are affected positively by the action rather than negative.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   There is a family of ethical problems which are called the tolling problems, which are related to this kind of decisions.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   We will talk about this later, I think I have some slides at the end related to this.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Then there is, as I said before, the various applied ethics and speaking of information technology, it's already several years, perhaps more than 10 years, more than 15 years, probably that the people started to talk about computer ethics.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Before, it was no one trying to speak about this.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   So why is computer ethics different from ethics in general?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   So do we need computer ethics? Or are there computer related IT related problems which can be addressed by should and can be addressed by ethics without the need to think to a different kind of ethics?
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Is it because if we only try to take the standard ethics, ethical reasoning is not enough?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   So the idea behind the practice of proposing and teaching and writing books and so on related to computer ethics is that yes, new technologies are opening new possibilities which are not there without.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   So these kind of issues are radically different.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And this is somehow, there is no more support because if you think to what is the kind of action which are enabled, emitted by information technology are radically different from what is without information technology.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   So we started to talk about so-called virtual reality where virtual should be taken as a meaning not physical, related to non-tangible objects, but not that it's not real.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   I think virtual in a sense is like a virtual machine is not a machine but is still a machine.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Or virtual reality is still real.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   So the escape of the concept is completely different. Nobody was really paying so much attention to fake news before the possibility to ride around in an explosive way fake news.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   So it was always possible and also happening that newspaper were printing something which was wrong, possibly by mistake, but also by embarkments or writing a book which is a big rate, the speed of diffusion of this kind of news.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   The breadth of the diffusion was completely different, completely uncomfortable with what is the possibility today with today's social networks.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   So all this to say that there are problems that are at least of a different kind without information technology or different problems.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   So there is an interesting question which is related to people like us who are somehow more or less involved with the creation of the technology.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   So it is the question if asking a medical issue, taking a medical decision should happen before or after the development of the technology.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   So if we think that something is wrong and it's there, okay we now try to ask for a regulation or advertise in public the ethical issues of why we think this is wrong and so on.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   But the other possibility is that if I as a developer, as someone more or less involved in the development of new technology, I try to steal or stop or participate in the development of this technology.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   It's not an easy question.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   There are many examples in which, you know, distance.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Am I responsible for the content of the information contained or communicated by the system I designed to develop?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   As a developer of Facebook, am I responsible of the fact that fake news are spread with Facebook more than without?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Or the fact that the very algorithm which is implemented in the way Facebook is promoting and deciding about the order of posts that is shown to a particular user is something which fevers fake news.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   It fevers the diffusion of news which are fake because they are more dramatic, unbelievable, strange, so they are more and more promoted.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   So the very algorithm designed by Facebook developers is supporting the diffusion of fake news by design.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Am I responsible for this if I am the developer of Facebook?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Can I claim that it is wrong news if I design that algorithm in this way?
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Or can I claim that it was impossible for me to figure out?
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   So basically I am saying I am not smart enough to learn how to do most of this.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Or should I download and install an authorized copy of a program for the benefit of my partner?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   For instance, an exam, a deadline tomorrow, the computer where he or she had the dead particular problem is broken, there is no other computer, it is late night.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Is it right that I download this program, a pirated copy which is something which is possibly violating your ethical view?
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Should I work for a project that involves military forces and offers me a very interesting position?
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   I am not saying what is right or wrong, many people do and they feel that it is perfect, it is not an issue.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Many other people don't because they say it is wrong.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   If they figure out there is a connection between their job and military education, it is not very easy to find the board.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   If the company developing weapons is offering you the position, it is very clear that it is a company.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   If it is a research grant that is broadcasted by a research institute, and then possibly the results of this research are used by someone developing weapons after it is published?
