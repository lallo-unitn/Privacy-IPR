[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.980]   --a significant topic in privacy and intellectual property
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.980]   rights because patents, as you know,
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:18.460]   are a relevant legal tool which has been created more than five
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.960]   hours ago for granting-- basically,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   for granting exclusive rights to a different-- the idea is
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   that patent, as regional intention, similar to other
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   legal protection for intellectual property,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.960]   aim to promote innovation.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.960]   So something supporting the inventor
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   in making a living of the invention.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   And there was even a Venetian patent statute
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.960]   toward the end of the 15th century,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.960]   which was probably the first patent system
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   in the European Union.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.460]   And patents were invented for new devices,
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960]   new ingenious devices, new creations of intent,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   not previously made, of course.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   And some of these patents were lasting for centuries.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.960]   There was not such a tiny situation like it is today.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   So the idea is that a patent is a sort of a limited monopoly.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   So the owner of a patent, the inventor,
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   filing for a patent, has the right
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   to decide to exclude somebody from the use unless they,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   for instance, pay royalties or come to some form of agreement
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   with the inventor himself.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   So this situation is interesting because there
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   is nothing which is-- there is no right to do things,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   to get granted to the inventor.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   There is more right to forbid things to other people.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   So the inventor or the owner of a patent
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   can exclude others for-- it seems to come in the real,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   but-- from using the invention.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.960]   But it's not necessarily granting the rights
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   to use the invention, even to the owner.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   There is a-- if you think of it, if there
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   is a patent for a particular device for writing
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   on a blackboard like this chalk, organized and prepared
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   in this cylindrical fashion and so on.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.960]   Then I patent another invention for coloring chalk.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   And so if somebody wants to create colored chalk,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   has to ask me the possibility to come
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   to an agreement with me, paying the royalties,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   paying something to me for being allowed to color chalk.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   And to someone else, the permission
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   to create chalk according to cylindrical form and so on.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   If I want to create cylindrical chalk colored,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   I don't have to ask anyone for the permission for coloring
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   chalk, for using the process for coloring.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   But I have to ask the permission to the owner of the idea
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   to the patent for creating cylindrical chalk,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   if I can, and to come to an agreement with this entity
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   for making cylindrical chalk.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   So I cannot use my patent unless someone else.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   I came to an agreement with someone else
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   for creating the previous invention on which my patent is
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   based.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   This is very typical for every patent,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   which is an improvement of a previous invention on whose
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   patent is owned by someone else.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   It's a very peculiar thing.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   But not so different from, if you think,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   how copyright applies to a piece of software, which
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   is, for instance, based on a previously created software.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   So I can do my improvement, but I still
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   have to fulfill the copyright of the previous existing
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   part, which I include in this software.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   And the viral close of GPL is very similar to that situation.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   It's exploiting the situation, if you want.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   So the patent has a territorial net range.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   The patent is not very per se in all the world, everywhere.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   There are agreements between countries
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   for extending the potential of the patent to each other,
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   but still, it's something which must be asked and paid for.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   There's a time range, maybe the number of years.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   Usually, it's 20 years from the filing date.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   And the timing is subject to the payment of a certain yearly fee.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   So a patent requires the payment of an yearly fee
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   for being valid.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   If I stop paying, the patent is lost.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   Then a patent requires the disclosure of the invention.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   So the patent, once it is approved, is public.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.960]   So patent offices do manage the publication
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.960]   of patents publicly available.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   So the patent office is the entity
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   which is normally managing patents in accounting.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   There's a patent office.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.960]   And the patent office is a private institution.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.960]   It's not a public entity.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   It's not normally managed by public administration.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   It is connected to the public administration,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   operating under law and so on and so forth.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   But it is a private entity, private organization.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.960]   And the service, which is done by the patent office,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   is the filtering of the request for patents.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.960]   So the side independent office is the entity
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   which decides if the patent should be granted
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   or not to the applicant.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   If I'm not happy with the decision of the patent office,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   possibly objecting my request for a patent,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.960]   I can, depending on the count, do the different ways
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   for appealing to this.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   And possibly is using a standard code
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   for filing a claim that my patent should be approved
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   and asking the court to advance the decision of the patent
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   office.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   So there are several differences with the copyright.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   But there is one very relevant common situation,
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   which is that the copyright is normally granted only
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   if I request a court to apply the copyright of my creation
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   and giving someone else, forbidding someone else
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   from doing something which is not allowed
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   by the copyright of my patent.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   So if I publish my program with GPM
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   and somebody is modifying the program
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   and distributing the modified version in, let's say,
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   satellite receiver, and they sell this thing, distribute,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   I have the right to ask the court
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   to force the entity which is violating my copyright
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   to stay with the copyright claims.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   For instance, there were companies
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   that were forced to apply the GPM statement for publishing
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   the modified version of software, which they didn't,
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   especially satellite receiver and things like that.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   So I have to ask, the court will not autonomously
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   decide that they notice a violation of the court
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   automatically proceed.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   And in general, this is true for all kinds of offenses
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   except the ones against the humans, so to say,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   or possibly the animals, in which case
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   the court can proceed autonomously.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   Otherwise, they need to file an interest.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   Same for the patent.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   If I think that my patent was violated by somebody,
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   breaking my-- using my invention,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   creating something for which I have the patent,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   it's me that I have to apply to the court to say, OK, hey,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960]   I have a patent which I filed.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   And in that case, the patent office
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   is acting as the entity which certifies that, yes, I
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   have a patent.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   And yes, the patent was approved on that particular date.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:32.960]   And so somebody created something
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   for which I have the patent after the patent has been filed.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   Then they are violating my right to exclude someone
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   from doing that.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   There are a couple of differences
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   between copyright and patents.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   One is very obvious.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   The copyright is immediate.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   I publish something, that thing has a copyright.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   I put the copyright statement in a piece of software.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   I upload the software in the newsletter.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.960]   And that's immediately applicable.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   The difference with the patent is
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   that the patent for being applicable
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   must be approved by one patent office.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   And it will be applicable in that particular account,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   if I may.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   So it's immediate and free.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   The copyright must be requested and its test cost, the patent.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   The duration is also different.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   The patent is lasting for 20 years, provided they are real.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   Copyright is lasting much longer.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   Copyright lasts for 50, 70, depending
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   on the resolution, years after the date of the copyright
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   law.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   There is also a default which should be taken into account,
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   which is that if I don't apply copyright to my intellectual
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   production-- let's say I write a program
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   and I upload to a server, make it public, without any copyright.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   I don't put anything on it.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   The fact that I publish and make it available to everyone
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   to see the program without stating anything about what
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   they can or cannot do, as a copyright owner,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   means that nobody can use it.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   The default for copyright is no one can do anything.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   So forget about the fact that this is violated
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   and for thousands of times every second probably,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   using material which is found on the web
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   and the fact that the vast majority of the people
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   are thinking that, or at least behaving,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   as if something which is published
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.960]   is by default usable for anything.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   Think about images.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   How many images are used daily without asking
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   to send to the copyright owner and without checking
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   if there is a copyright attached to it.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   So it's a very common standard practice.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   Aside from this, the legal default
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   is that if there is no copyright, it
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.960]   is not that this particular artifact is in the public
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   domain, but it's the opposite.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   It's all rights itself.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   The default for a patent is just the opposite.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   If I create a process for a coloring chalk
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   and I don't ask-- I don't file a request for a patent for this,
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   this is something which if someone else sees my colored
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   chalk and figures out how to do it,
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   possibly using my process the same,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   possibly bribing one of my employees of my company
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   creating colored chalk and asking how we do colored chalk
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   and they do replicate the same process,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   I have no legal tool for saying no,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   I am the inventor of coloring and you cannot use it unless I
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   look at it.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   If they figure out, they can do it.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   Or if they steal the idea and they cannot prove it.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   So it's just the opposite.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   There are some relevant sources about patents.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   There's a European patent convention.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   In the US, there is something which is called Title 35.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   And then there are international agreements
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   which are regulating or creating agreements
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   between countries, especially TRIPS,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   this agreement on trade related aspects
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   of intellectual property and ICM.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   We heard from the past probably in this class, in this course.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   And the TRIPS is an agreement which
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   is signed by the countries which are
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   part of the so-called WTO, World Trade Organization, which
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   is a corporation which is a commercial agreement
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   between countries.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   Related to patents, there was an interesting decision
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   which was in part of the TRIPS agreements, which
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   was taken in late--
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   between '95 and 2000, at the end of the previous millennium.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   And which was interesting because it
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   was lowering the validity of patents for developing
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   countries.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   So basically stating that pharmaceutical products,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   medicine, don't have the validity of patents
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   related to pharmaceutical products,
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   did not extend to low-income developing countries.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   For the generic version, especially of this-- so
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   basically reducing the validity of the patents
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   for pharmaceutical products.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   Reducing and making it possible for developing
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   pharmaceutical companies established
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   in developing countries to create
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   generic version of medicines.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   I didn't check actually if this is still there.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   There was quite a bit of dispute about that.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   It was eventually signed.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   But I think it was a extension--
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   a time extension that probably could be as far as I know.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.960]   And then there are local regulations.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   For instance, within University of Trento,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   there is a whole regulation on intellectual property,
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   which is mainly covering patents.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   And that regulation is stating how much
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   and how the university is entitled to the benefits, which
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.960]   are coming from a patent obtained by a university
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.960]   researcher.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   With the term researcher, in that document,
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   that regulation, it means anyone,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   from professors to postdocs to doctoral students
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   to students of all sorts, to you.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.960]   So if you discover something, you want to create something,
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   and you want to patent it, then the university
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   has some right on your invention.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   And you have to discuss this with the university
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   about this entitled to take decision that matter.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   But the interesting part is that the university
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   is, if you ask for and they approve your request,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   they are willing to take the burden of filing the patent,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   which is expensive.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.960]   It requires a lot of work.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   It requires a lot of paying a lawyer, for instance,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   for doing it, and so on and so forth.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   In exchange, the university wants 50%
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   of the revenues of the patent.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   So if you don't have the resources for filing your own patent,
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   and you think, OK, I am ready to give up half of the revenues
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   to the university because they are having me filing the patent,
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   that's OK.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   But in general, the minimum, I think,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   that the university is taking is 30% of the patents
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   filed by somebody, which is within their own--
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.960]   the realm of the university.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   I'm sure this is valid if you, for instance,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   if you study computer science and you
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   file a patent for a pharmaceutical product,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   maybe this doesn't work because you
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   can stay with this previous knowledge, independent knowledge
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   that you're using.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   So the university has nothing to do with this.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   But you should do something which is within your activity
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   within the university.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   That's the university as a portion of the rights.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   So the European Patent Convention is a ruling patent.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   And what we will focus mainly is what
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   is more relevant for software.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   If these kind of sources are allowing or not,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   software to be better.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   So the European Patent Convention
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.960]   is granting patents for any invention they write,
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   which are susceptible of industrial application, which
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   are new, and which in modern invent is certain.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   And then they exclude from this to invention
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   with the discoveries and different theories
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   and mathematical methods.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   I evidence I like the mathematical methods
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   because the software is considered
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   very close to mathematical methods.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   And other things is the creation and so on.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   So if you want to protect your paintings,
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   you should use copyrights rather than patents.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Because patents only apply to what
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   is an industrial application.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.960]   So that's the application when you invent a step.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   And the European Patent Convention
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   is also defining what the meaning of these terms.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   So for instance, they say that new
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   is something which is not part of the so-called state
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   of the art.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   And state of the art is the set of everything
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.960]   which is available to the public before the date
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   of the filing of the new development.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   Which means that if you are publishing
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   scientific papers or your dissertation or anything else
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   which is available to the public,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.960]   and then you want to patent something
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   which is described in that particular publication,
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.960]   then your own publication is in the state of the art.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   And the European Independent Office
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   should reject your applications.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   Because it's such a novel invention.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   It has been already described.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   So you cannot publish something and then say, oh, yeah,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   I should patent that.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   And then we find the patent.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   Because you figure out that somebody else
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   is exploiting your idea based on the publication you distribute.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   They are creating the problem and they are making more money.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   And you say, oh, no, no, I am the inventor.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   I want the patent.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   That's it.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   Then they say, does it mean to be an inventive step?
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Inventive step is something which is not obvious.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   And this is very controversial because they
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   find that something is obvious or not
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   is a little bit difficult. It's not
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   so crisply defined.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   And so we will see some example of this.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   There are numerous examples of patents which
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   were granted for things which are really obvious.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.960]   And then what is an industrial application?
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   It is simply something which can be used in any kind of industry.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   If the invention is an industrial application,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   it means that it can be used by any kind of industry.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Agriculture, in that case, is a citizen industry.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   And then related to the application, as I said,
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   an application should be created in a way which is disclosing.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   They mention that in a way which makes it possible to create
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   the patented thing.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   So if you are patenting a process
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.960]   for creating a chemical product, if you
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   are patenting the process for coloring chalk,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   if you are patenting a new kind of water bottle,
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   if you are patenting a particular mechanism
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   for improving the feedback of keys in a keyboard, and so on,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   the application, the request for the patent
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   that you send to a patent office must disclose the invention
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   in a way which is basically enough for producing
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   what you are asking the patent for.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   So the description should be extremely detailed
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   and technically sound.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   So enough for someone to understand fully
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   the details for creating something equal.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   And then this is done because the patent office needs to,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   for instance, to be able to reject the patent
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   asked by someone else with a similar invention comparing
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   the two descriptions.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   Yes?
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   You have to speak louder because there is a lot of noise
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   by the--
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   You are right, but it's apparently a contradiction.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   The public is the description.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.960]   The fact that it must be seen in the capacity.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   So you have to be careful with timing
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   because if I make known to the public something
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   and then I ask the patent, that would be a difference.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   When I asked if something is--
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   I kept something secret.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   I wait for publishing my scientific paper
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   because I think that I can patent that invention.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   I wait for participation and I find the patent.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   I find the patent and then with all the description,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   complete description.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   But that is kept secret by the patent office
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   until they reach a decision.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   When they approve the patent, then this patent
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   will be participated.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   Then I can publish my paper.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   Then someone else can read my patent
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   and decide according to the very detailed description
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   if they are willing to pay for the patent.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   So to sign a contract with me, basically,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   where I allow them to develop their own industry
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   for current chokes.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   And I ask for whatever kind of money
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   I want for creating chokes or that kind of business.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   And then they need to read the complete description.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.960]   Or someone else has the idea to process for creating chokes.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   And they do a search and say, oh, yeah.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.960]   Someone else has invented a process for creating chokes.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   But maybe their process is different.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   So if the result is the same but the process is different,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   they are welcome to fight their own patent for current chokes.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   But they need to be able to decide
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   if their process is different or equal.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   And we'll go to this later.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   It's clear enough, the patent.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   But that's not patent.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   They will have a patent for the process.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   So if you want to keep the secret,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   you just don't fight for a patent.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   If you're able to keep the secret, that's fine.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   But if somebody in a person, Gina, your product,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   your Coca-Cola, they find out the way
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   for producing something which tastes equal and looks
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   equal to the beverage, they can do it.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   It's very difficult, of course, because if you
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   want to have something that's created on the final product,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.960]   it's easy.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   But yes, if you want to patent, you must disclose the process.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   In the US, the US Code Title 35 stated
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   that the inventions are patentable
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   and the regulation of the patent is basically the same
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   as the European invention.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   Whether it invents or discovers any new or induced
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   to process the machine, manufacture, proposition,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   or matter of any new or useful improvements,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   may obtain a patent subject to a condition
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   required by this time.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   But basically, the same, different language,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   what the taste, what does it matter.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   And from this is excluded the possibility
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   to patent laws of natural physical phenomena
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   and abstract ideas.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   And it was particularly decided by a case which
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   went to the Supreme Court, which was somebody inventing pencil,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   I think, inventing a method for--
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   so it was something for converting
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   numbers of different bases in a particular efficient way
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   and the--
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   so using a computer, I think, or whatever.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   So the patent office, they rejected the patent application.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   And then the pre-counter escalated
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   to a court, which is established in the US, which
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   is taking care of these kind of cases, patents
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   and other intellectual property issues.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   And they revert the--
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   they revert the decision of the patent office.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   So they stated that, yes, the patent should be granted.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   But then some member of the patent office,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   or probably the director of the patent office,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   did file a request to the Supreme Court for the bad singer,
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.960]   restating the initial decision of the patent office.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   And they succeeded.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   So it was approved.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   The objection of that patent was approved.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   And the patent was stating-- and the decision of this report
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   was stating something, what is written here.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   Direct attempts to patent programs have been rejected.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   Attempts to obtain patents without the rejection
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   are confused.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   The issue further should not be permitted.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   So basically, it's stating that patents should not
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   be guaranteed.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   But that was not the case for a moment.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   In a moment, basically, there are several parts
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   of this title, 35, which are related to the description,
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   what is the conditions for-- the condition for a patent
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   to be granted.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   For instance, here, the specification,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   as I said before, must be full, clear, precise,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.960]   and excited.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   It's stating very precisely what does it mean
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   to specify the proper invention.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   And in this title, to define this is clarified in details.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   So speaking of software, the fundamental question here
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   is, is software patentable?
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   And in general, neither software nor data structures
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   are per se patentable as such, which
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   is to create a patent for a piece of software.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.960]   But it is not everywhere the same.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   Because remember that patents are regional validity,
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   territory, and not everywhere the same.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.960]   So for instance, in a very relevant country
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   related to software, software is patentable.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   Because that decision, which I said before,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.960]   this decision from the Supreme Court,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   which was basically the one in the '60s and the '70s,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   was that no protection if the invention is a computer product.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   Then in the '80s, it went to the decision
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   that some computer inventions are patentable, especially
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   the ones embedded in devices.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   And then in the '90s, basically, the situation
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   was already that almost all software is patentable,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   which is the case nowadays in the US.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   You may apply for a patent on your piece of software
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   in the US, which means that the validity of the patent
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   is within the US.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   It's not in Europe.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   It's not.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   And this particular evolution of the US legislation,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   what is the heavy legislation can evolve.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.960]   But in the US in particular, where they have a case-based
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   law, this kind of evolution is possibly faster
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   than in other situations.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   - OK.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   One important case is what happened,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   which was the opening in the Isha Park in the '80s,
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   is related to devices using software.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   So in that case, it was in the '80s stated by the US Patent
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   and Tenderness Office that it is possible to patent the system
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.960]   as a whole, including the software.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   So software which is part of something--
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   and this is a case here--
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   and there, the group stated that an argument is not
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   better, but the program created by the user
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   implemented that algorithm embedded
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:49.960]   in a particular device, physical device, yes, can be better.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   Which is a very broad definition.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.960]   You may think of many things like this.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   For instance, fitness watch is a device
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   which is a mini software, and then a particular software.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   OK.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   Well, this is the--
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   some more about the case, but maybe we
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   won't go into all of these details.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   But basically, I already mentioned this.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.460]   Yes.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:38.960]   The language.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   So basically, importing the decision,
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   those natural phenomena, absolutely, the idea
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   cannot be patented.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   But software implemented the machine, yes.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   So ending this was a evolving, and then several other decisions
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   by the US Patent and Trade Act Office,
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   and various courts, where people are appealing against decision
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   of the patent office, which was objective to software patents.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   And then at the end of the day, the patentability of software
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   was established, and there were even guidelines
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:29.960]   for how to accept patents, requests related to software.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   In Europe, on the other hand, there
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   is especially one specific article
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   of the European Patent Convention, which
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   is excluding from product for computers from patentability.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   As a computer problem as such cannot be patented.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   Still, it is possible to attempt a device which
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   is using a computer problem.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   So there is a very large debate about the patentability
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   of software, of course.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   And there is also some peculiarity
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   in the application of patents to software.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   For instance, in the US, as we were discussing before,
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   when a patent is granted for anything
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.960]   in the process of a problem, I have
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   to disclose all the details about this process.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   For software, this is not the case.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   I am not forced to disclose the source code of the software
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   for which I am asking for a patent.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   So what I am requested to do is a description
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.960]   of the computational ideas, so to say,
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.960]   in terms of what I want to patent.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.960]   So I have to, what I am forcing, then if I want,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   I can also include the source code in my patent application.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   But that's not mandatory.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   Any general, not that one.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   So this has created a situation which is very peculiar.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   So for instance, some patents have
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:42:02.960]   been granted which became very, very good arguments
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   against software patents.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   Because the British telecom was able to obtain
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.960]   a patent for the link.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   The implementation idea, basically,
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   that you can have a link between one artifact present
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   in the web and another one connected
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.960]   to things with a link, which is a piece of text you click on
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   and is embedded in the code needed for showing you,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   for presenting you, another piece of text.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   And they obtained that patent after the establishment
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   of the web.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   The office didn't, apparently didn't do the job properly.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   But this is just one or several examples.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   Plug-in, the notion of the plug-in,
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   or the example which I can install in connection
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:13.960]   with another piece of software, plug-in for browser,
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   so that the behavior of the software
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   is changed and regulated by the plug-in.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   And so this idea was a patent that after having
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:29.960]   been implemented by companies like Mozilla and others,
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.960]   and there were also legal disputes, of course,
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.960]   by the one who obtained that patent.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   And then the opponents were able to know that patent should
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   not be granted, should have not be granted to start with.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   So you cannot claim that patent because the patent office did
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   something wrong in accepting your request.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   Or the one-click shopping, from Amazon,
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   if you buy for something in Amazon,
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   you have this one-click button, which is taking one click,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   and you click on the button, you see the product,
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   you click on the button, and immediately,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   but the product is immediately in your cart,
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   and you are on your way to be paid.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   And this is-- they managed to obtain a patent for this,
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   which is a business process, basically.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   And so it's-- all these kinds of patents
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   are being granted to companies requesting this kind of stuff
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.960]   are a very good argument against software patents.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   Because people are saying, well, if you can patent something
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   which is so obvious, some company managed
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   to patent the XOR, the implementation of the XOR,
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   in software, not in hardware, which could be understandable.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   This thing is understandable if not already implemented
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   by thousands of other producers.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   So clearly, if somebody can obtain a patent
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.960]   for the execution of the exclusive work,
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   just because the language they use
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   is obscure enough for the patent officer,
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   reading the claim, to say, this is something new,
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   it means that they are not competent enough
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.960]   for evaluating this.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   This is the argument against patent, of course.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   And then the other thing is that nowadays, software patents--
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   also other kinds of patents, but in particular software patents--
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   are more a protection from large companies towards innovations
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   from others, from competitors, rather than--
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   so something like a mutual retaliation
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   between large companies, rather than being supportive
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   of innovation by protecting the inventor from others
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   to steal the invention for their own benefit.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   So what happens in practice--
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   and that's the idea about against software patents,
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.960]   one reason for criticism--
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   is that the small company with a good idea,
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   which is possibly filing a patent,
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   is probably in their own creation, in their own activity,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.960]   violating hundreds of patents owned by large companies.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   And if a large company like Microsoft, Google,
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:59.960]   is suing a small company, like a startup with three people,
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   three very bright, young computer scientists,
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.960]   which are creating something very new,
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   and they patent their thing, and the large company
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   tries to buy this small software house, small software company,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   and they don't reach an agreement,
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   then they claim that the small software producer
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   is violating several patents by large companies like Google
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.960]   or Microsoft or whatever.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:41.960]   And even if the small company, the small startup,
89[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   would win in court against the giant,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   the problem is that the financial resources
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   for facing such a trial are out of question for the small company.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.960]   So it's-- and there are cases like this.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   So apparently, what is happening with the usage
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   of the patents in software companies
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   is that they have enough patents that if another one is suing them,
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   they reach an agreement because they say, OK,
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   if you sue me for violation of these 20 patents,
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   I wish I would sue you because you're violating 50 patents
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   over the day, and so on and so forth.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   So they basically stop, or they are prevented from this
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   because it's not worked in most cases.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   So speaking of strange patents which have been granted,
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   this is a very numerous case which happened in Australia in 2001.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   Somebody managed to obtain a patent by describing something
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   which was basically the will.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   And the patent office, the examiners,
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   didn't realize that the patent-- it was done on purpose.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   It was done for showing that the patent office is very inclined
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   to grant patents rather than to reject patents.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   So if the description is obscure enough,
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:31.960]   they managed to obtain the patent for the will, which is clearly wrong.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   This is another thing which was done by the Electronic Freedom Foundation
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   for supporting their claim against software patents.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   And this is one page of the-- just one web page,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   which is where they found 20 patents which are, if you read them,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   there is a list of-- so for instance, things that are patented,
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   selling something over a mobile phone network,
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   selling things over a network using a server, a client, a payment,
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.960]   a processor, or using a payment, a client or a service,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   an electronics shopping cart, preview window.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.960]   If you read this patent cell, there are existing patents,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   there is the patent cell.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   So they are really paying with credit cards on the internet.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:43.960]   All these seem to be very unreasonable, this patent cell.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   Here you can find the description of the one click.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   I mentioned this.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   And this is inspired by the way.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   The mobile phone market is a very interesting case,
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:13.960]   source of cases related to information technology patents.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   There is-- this estimate, which is dated in 2012,
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.960]   somebody did estimate, and you can see the reference there,
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   that in a mobile phone there are 250,000 patents
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   for the thing which are in the mobile phone.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.960]   And there are also very interesting cases
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   of fight between different large companies.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   Apple against Samsung, and Blockstar,
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.960]   which is a Canadian company, against Google.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.960]   So, you know, then all these--
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   for instance, this one was something related to the idea
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   of associating advertisement related to a search,
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   which is done by the user.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   The very central point of the board advertisement procedure,
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   process, and they-- this was a patent which was--
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   the company having this patent, the--
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:54.960]   was-- went bankrupt.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   The Canadian company, which had this particular patent,
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   went bankrupt.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   And then there was an option for the patents
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   that this company had.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   And Google was running for this, buying this patent.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   They put the bid.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   And then Blockstar, which was--
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   so a company created by Microsoft, by Paul and Sonny
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   and others, did compete, and they win.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:33.960]   They paid a few billions dollars for this, for buying this patent.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   And then there was a--
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   and then this became part of the mutual retaliation
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.960]   that I mentioned before between companies
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   for preventing them to switch other
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   and to win in the competition, against competitors
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   using patents as a weapon.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   It's like the Cold War situation.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   Russia and the United States, they
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   have nuclear weapons pointing to each other
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   as a mutual dissuasion for starting a war.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   So basically, in the software patents realm,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   it seems that it is the same situation.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   And for instance, and in particular for free software,
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.960]   that's a problem.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:36.960]   And it wouldn't be an issue for free software companies,
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   for free software creators, that there are software patents
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:48.960]   used by large companies in their competing strategies.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   Between the service, there was not
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.960]   some consequences on free software.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:55:04.920]   and one of the things which is central in Flusopter
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:11.040]   is the dichotomy between what can be an idea
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.960]   and the spression of the idea.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.680]   The idea is the sort that the idea of a sort of guide monitor
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.220]   and implementation is the special idea
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:27.200]   is how I write the code I write for that particular area.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   If you can patent the idea, the new sorting algorithm,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.360]   which means that any implementation of that idea
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.520]   is then protected by the patent, but that's
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:49.880]   a very big problem for a patent for a true sort.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.800]   Then the reverse engineering possibility
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.600]   is somehow affected by patent regulations.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:09.400]   So it's creating a lot of problems,
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:15.720]   also because if a large company is claiming
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.200]   that a piece of Flusopter is violating their own patent,
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.120]   that there is very little that can
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.480]   be done by the creator of that software
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:31.000]   if it is not another big company for resisting to that break.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:38.360]   That's why some large companies did support the creation
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:46.600]   of so-called patent pools with a set of patents,
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:54.240]   which are bought or donated by large companies in support
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:01.480]   of the software so that free software developers can create
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.240]   software which could be possibly covered by these patents,
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:13.240]   but with being reassured that that will not be applied.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:17.480]   So this is something supporting.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.160]   Maybe it's only public relation for the ones who
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.640]   are supporting this, which are like IBM, Google,
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:32.360]   it support that [INAUDIBLE]
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.040]   And there are some--
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:45.400]   also, in some cases, which is infamous for the usage
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:52.640]   of patents against free software projects like Samba.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:58:00.560]   Samba is a system for five server shared
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.920]   with the network using--
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:10.520]   allowing Linux system to access Microsoft servers
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:16.160]   and also for printing using Microsoft-based servers.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.560]   And so there was a--
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:31.600]   Microsoft suing the developers of Samba for the claim--
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.840]   with the claim that they were violating the Microsoft patents.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.520]   What happened is that Samba developer basically
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.400]   took it shorter and to change the way they created it.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.360]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:59:03.840]   OK, do you have questions?
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.320]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.440]   I want to show you this interesting--
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:30.960]   this is a comic set with a book.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:41.760]   And it's a very interesting exchange
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:46.160]   against the patenting of invention
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.880]   like it was particularly inspired by the patenting
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.000]   of the human genome.
[00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:06.280]   And the-- it's stating, ladies and gentlemen of the board,
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.240]   I'm pleased to announce that we successfully
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.280]   won the rights to Snow.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:18.920]   So it's also changing the name to global [INAUDIBLE]
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.880]   Max Flake, which is the name of the company.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:27.800]   Christmas.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:34.280]   So all this-- everything related to Snow.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:45.840]   And so either comics, critics to the possibility of patent,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.320]   things like the human genome.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:01:01.840]   So what you see as the main differences between patents
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.880]   and copyright between the syntactical ones.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.160]   The fact that patent has a cost and that copyright
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.960]   has not and so on.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:17.360]   In terms of the topics of this course until now.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:33.120]   I think that patents covers like invention and new research,
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.600]   things like that.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   While copyright protects like original work from artists
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.720]   and writer, singers.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.760]   OK.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.640]   Oh, singers.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.560]   I forgot to mention before that I
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.920]   said that the copyright is not automatically applied
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   if the writer has patents.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.960]   For copyright, there is a specific distinction
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.680]   which is related to music, singers.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.760]   Which is that there are organizations which are
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.960]   basically unions of--
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.720]   or singers to unions of musicians
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.480]   that are on behalf of their members,
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.680]   filing and taking care of the application of copyright.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:36.160]   Against the tragedies basically in the music.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.560]   To support the members.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.440]   It's not automatic, but it still is a little bit of support
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.520]   and for the copyright.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.080]   Yes, this is correct what you said.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   I mean the distinction between the expression
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.640]   and the idea, which is a copyright and a patent.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.520]   But there are impacts, for instance,
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.560]   on information technology in general.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:16.040]   Because one of the differences is
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:23.400]   what is the needs--
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.280]   the process for having a copyright protection
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.360]   or the process for having a patent protection.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.960]   And the extent of the protection of the inventor.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.160]   It's not by accident that the university
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.040]   is interested in supporting-- possibly supporting
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.680]   filing of patents by its own researchers
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.480]   and not really caring about copyright appointed or not
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.000]   to the work of their researcher.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Because patent is where the money is,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   copyright is not where the money is.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:27.960]   What the-- it's not by accident that the initial ideas
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.320]   and the debate about the creation of this software
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.440]   was in the direction of using copyright in a creative way,
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.720]   so to say, for stating something which
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.600]   is in the language of the software is granting freedom.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:52.000]   And they choose to use copyright for this and not patents.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.800]   First of all, because it was not so easy at the time,
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.040]   but still in the US that would be
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.400]   more feasible to find a creative way to use patents.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.880]   But it was much more difficult, much more complicated.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.520]   So they basically, as we said already,
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.640]   copyright is the legal institution
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.160]   which is the legal artifacts, which
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.240]   is making it possible that the existence of free software.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.960]   Patents are more the opposite, something
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   which could be used against the existence of free software.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:43.240]   More questions or comments?
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.740]   Yes.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:06:04.680]   We are done for today.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:09.120]   Remember that tomorrow there is Andrea, or Satu.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.520]   I will see you next week.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.020]   OK.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:12.520]   Thank you.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.020]   Thank you.
